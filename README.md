hello!

I'm an undergrad student at BITS hyderabad. As a part of my minor in finance, I have taken up few courses, and have done some cool assignments as a part of the coursework. I have shared all the files, code snippets etc used so that they can be used as a template for your projects in finance domain. I felt that this is just a tiny bit of support to all the finance, fintech, enthusiasts in this community.

Please feel free to clone download/fork and use them for your purposes. Let me know if there are any discrepancies in the tools or methods used. Everyone learns after making mistakes.

Each directory/ rar file contains necessary files for working and detailed reports to understand the workings used. Use them to build new projects if you feel these are useful.

Suggestion: please don't directly submit these files by changing names as they defeat the sole purpose of learning. Whatever knowledge I have gained from these courses, is reflected in these workings. So use these as templates for your projects.

Thanks to All my team members, who were part of some of these projects, and helped me learn so many new things by interacting and working with them on these projects.

thank you for reading till the last line.
